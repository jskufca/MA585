# Loading packages

Our intention is to use packages from the tidyverse and other *tidy* packages to provide a constistant framework.      



```{r}

library(readr) # reading data files
library(lubridate) # working with dates
library(broom)
library(sf) #mapping and geospatial
library(tmap)
library(GISTools)
library(tidyverse) # data manipulation and visualization - loads several packages
```

Some addition packages as indicated for the Bayesian work:


```{r}
library(foreign)
```


# Reading Data


```{r}
dffull=read.dta("pew_research_center_june_elect_wknd_data.dta")
df=read_csv("2008ElectionResult.csv")
```
